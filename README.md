# What is GIFActif ?

GIFActif is a [Giphy](http://giphy.com/) search plugin for the free forum service, [Forumotion](http://www.forumotion.com/) aka [Forumactif](http://www.forumactif.com/). GIFActif adds a new button to the message editor which allows your members to attach GIFs to their messages, thus making the experience more engaging.. and fun !

GIFActif uses the [Giphy Search API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#search-endpoint) to find GIFs just for you !
