# What is GIFActif ?

GIFActif is a [Giphy](http://giphy.com/) search plugin for the free forum service, [Forumotion](http://www.forumotion.com/) aka [Forumactif](http://www.forumactif.com/). GIFActif adds a new button to the message editor that gives your members the ability to search for GIFS and attach them to their messages without ever leaving the page !

GIFActif uses the [Giphy Search API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#search-endpoint) to find GIFs just for you ! Why express yourself with just words alone when you can add a GIF to liven things up ?
